1. If a city name is used multiple times around the world, use 
coords to pick a specific iteration of said city. Thef mentioned
Google Maps API. 

2. Convert between celcius and fahrenheit. 
  2.1. API on enter of input only. Not on the conversion of temperature.
        Every time you hit the temperature button, you're making a new call on the API. Stop from this happening and only
        call the API on pressing the enter key in the input field. - NOICE
  2.2. Clean up this function(s). - NOICE

3. Show city and country - Reintroduce

4. Different time periods for weather, e.g 5 day
  4.1 - Clean it up.
  4.2 Display hour by hour
  4.3 Slightly break apart the createParent function and have one for 5Day and one for current. Share the same code as much as poss. 


5. Look through API and see if there is anything interesting to add. 

6. Get Rom to restyle this bloody thing. It looks like a fart. - Partially finished.

7. Look at other Weather API's and identify how you would handle them.

8. Return an error message if city does not exist. 


9. Background color should change depending on the weather. 
e.g. clouds, rain, sun, etc.

10. Add columns for different stats; i.e. wind speeds, temperature high/low/mid(averaged), humidity, etc. 
  10.1. Style the table to show information clearly, it currently looks like a fart.
  10.2 Overall each day, for ease of use and vision.  

HOMEWORK - Plan the attack for adding more columns based on the logic found in lines 55-77.

Just before the end, push this to Github.
At the end, tidy it all up.
